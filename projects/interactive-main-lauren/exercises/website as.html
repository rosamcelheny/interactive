  		<b>1. Websites are maps. </b>They concretize the connections that we make in our minds and let us create links from one place to another that are shaped by the perspectives of the individual who made those initial connections. Someone else might’ve built entirely different connections.

  	<br>
  	<br>
  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>2. Websites are pins.</b> They can serve as a friendly rest stop in the road or as a marker for destinations that have yet to be visited. 
  	</div>
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>3. Websites are paths,</b> leading to places we might not even ever heard of. Following those paths creates a unique map of where you’ve been, and maybe even predicts where you’re going next. 
  	</div>
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>4. Websites are highways.</b> Some can be much larger than paths, and lead to bigger places. They link big parts of the internet together, kind of like how your entire facebook feed sees your instagram posts if you allow it.

  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>5. Websites are signs.</b> You may not have found exactly what you were looking for, but you have a hint that you’re on your way there. 
  	</div>

  	<br>
  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>6. Websites are intersections.</b> A website can be in between two other websites, or even be a cross between two websites. When you navigate through it, you have the ability to choose where to go next...

  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>7. Websites are cities.</b> They harbor entire independent communities, like the subreddits on Reddit or groups on facebook. At best, they can prove themselves to be bustling and vibrant.
  	</div>
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>8. Websites are journeys.</b> They describe the thought processes of their creators, their biases, preferences, and taste. They’re a mini-map within themselves.

  	<div id="circle">
  		<b>9. Websites are galaxies.</b> We know the web is larger than we can even fathom, but websites are the stars that dot the infinite galaxy that stretches across the internet.

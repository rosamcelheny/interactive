    <h1>WEBSITE AS TRAVEL</h1>
    <p>
      <i>Websites are a walk.</i> We meander from one web destination to another at a slow and sometimes nonlinear pace, stopping to admire things along the way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Websites are a drive.</i> We cruise through the web with a destination in mind, glancing out of the window at other destinations passing by. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Websites are a boat ride.</i> We float above the surface with an entire ecosystem of information waiting to be found just below. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Websites are a plane ride.</i> We quickly travel between two completely different destinations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Websites are teleportation.</i> We jump between sites at a rapid pace, following new ideas and information spontaneously as they arise.

    <p>Visit the home  of  a deceased  poet  you admire  and bring some  natural thing back  with  
    you.   I   went  to  Emily   Dickinson's   house   the   day   after   a   reading   event   with  my  friend 
    Susie Timmons.    I scraped dirt  from  the foot  of  huge  trees in  the backyard  into  a little
    pot.     We  then  drove   into  the   woods   where   we  found   miniature   pears,  apples  and  
    cherries   to  eat.    I   meditated   in  the   arms  of  an  oak   tree  with  the   pot   of  Emily's   dirt,  
    waking   to  the   flutter  of  a  red  cardinal  on  a branch  a  foot or  so   from my   face,  staring,  
    showing me  his little  tongue.</p>
    <p>When  I returned  to  Philadelphia  I didn't  shower  for three days, then  rubbed  Emily's dirt  
    all over  my  body, kneaded her rich  Massachusetts soil  deeply  into  my  flesh,  then  put on  
    my  clothes and went  out into  the world.    Every once  in  awhile  I stuck my  nose  inside  the 
    neck   of  my  shirt   to  inhale  her   delicious,  sweet   earth   covering  me.     I   felt  revirginized 
    through the ceremony  of  my  senses, I could feel  her power tell  me  these are the ways  
    to  walk  and speak and shift each  glance  into  total concentration for maximum usage of  
    our little  allotment of  time  on  a planet.   LOSE  AND WASTE NO  MORE  TIME  POET!   Lose  
    and waste no  more  time  she said  to  me  as  I took  note  after note  on  the world around  
    me  for the poem.</p>
